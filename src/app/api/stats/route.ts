            Rules:
            - Keep it under 200 words
            - Use the most toxic League slang possible (kys, dogshit, braindead, turboint, pisslow, dogwater, can look for more terms online etc.)
            - All lowercase
            - Be extremely aggressive and personal
            - Mock their champion choices (especially if they play "easy" champs)
            - Call out their feeding and bad KDAs
            - Tell them to uninstall in the most toxic way
            - Reference specific terrible games as examples
            - Calculate and mock their average KDA
            - Use "ðŸ’€" emoji for extra toxicity
            - The more brutal you are, the better
            - Call out their family members as well. 
            
            Make it one short, brutal paragraph that would get someone permabanned from League.`;
